# Surfing the "Silver Tsunami" at Pewlett Hackard

## Overview of the Analysis

Pewlett Hackard is faced with a massive amount of retirements in the next 3-5 years. A tremendous amount of  
institutional knowledge will be lost in this "silver tsunami". It is imperative that Pewlett Hackard find a way  
to pass on as much accumulated knowledge, skills, and expertise from its senior employees to the younger generations  
of employees. To that end, management has developed the framework for a mentorship program in which younger employees  
would be paired up with a senior employee in their department to engage in knowledge transfer.

However, management does not have insight into just how many employees are nearing retirement and which job titles they hold.  
Additionally, management needs to know how many employees would be elibible for the mentorship program. It may not be a perfect  
solution, but the program would go a long way toward mitigating the worst effects of the "silver tsunami" if it were to go unaddressed.  
To that end, we provide the following deliverables in this analysis:

- The number of retiring employees by job title (CSV file)

- The number of employees eligible for the mentorship program (CSV file)

- This written report

## Analysis Results

### Retiring Employees by Title

- A total of 72,458 employees are in the pipeline for retirement. 

- The vast majority of retirements will come from the ranks of Senior Engineer (35.8%) and Senior Staff (34.4%).

### Number of Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program

- A total of 1.549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

- The vast majority of eligible employees are in the ranks of Senior Staff (36.7%) and Engineer (32.3%).

## Analysis Summary

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Pewlett Hackard is set to lose a truly massive number of experienced employees in the coming years. Combining all  
engineering titles on the retirement list gives us 36,291. Compare that to the number of all engineers  
(Senior Engineer, Engineer, and Assistant Engineer) eligible for mentorship: 748. The company may not need to fill  
every single engineering postion that will be lost but nonetheless will need to hire thousands - perhaps tens of thousands -  
of new engineers over the next decade. The same is largely true for Senior Staff and Staff job titles. Remaining job titles  
(Techique Leader, Manager) have much smaller numbers retiring, so we don't anticipate to much of an issue backfilling those  
positions.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The good news is that we have a surfeit of qualified, retirement-ready employees who could serve as mentors. As a matter of fact,  
we think we can fill all the needed mentor positions with volunteers. We encourage managers to start identifying the best of the best  
in their departments and recruiting them for the mentorship program.

### Are there additional Queries/Tables that could provide more insight into the "silver tsunami"?

We think it would be interesting for Pewlett Hackard leadership to see the salaries of the soon-to-be-retiring employees. It will be  
very expensive to bring on the tens of thousands of new employees over the next decade. In addition, many of the younger employees  
who complete the mentorship program will likely be in line for promotions in the near term. The Hewlett Packard Finance and Human  
Resources departments will have to work in tandem to craft competitive salary packages to retain our remaining talent as well as  
onboard new talent.

Another analysis that could be of interest to Hewlett Packard leadership involves our managers. Just as teachers get burned out  
easily when the number of students in their classrooms increase, our management cadre could also easily get overwhelmed navigating  
the "silver tsunami", training/mentorship of the next generation of employees, and onboarding of brand new hires. We could analyze  
our data to find out the ratio of managers to job titles and make adjustments if necessary.
